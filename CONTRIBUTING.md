- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control
- A GitHub account

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/TeachSpark.git
   cd TeachSpark
   ```

3. **Add the upstream repository**:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/MarkHazleton/TeachSpark.git
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   cd TeachSpark.Web
   npm install
   ```

5. **Verify the setup**:

   ```

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Creating a Feature Branch

1. **Sync with upstream**:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull upstream main
   ```

2. **Create a feature branch**:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Making Changes

1. **Follow our coding standards** (enforced by pre-commit hooks)
2. **Write clear, descriptive commit messages**
3. **Keep commits focused** - one logical change per commit
4. **Test your changes** thoroughly

### Code Quality Requirements

All code must pass our quality checks:

```bash
# Run all quality checks
npm run quality

# Auto-fix issues where possible
npm run quality:fix

# Individual checks
npm run lint        # JavaScript linting
npm run lint:css    # SCSS/CSS linting
npm run format      # Code formatting
```

### Submitting Changes

1. **Push your branch**:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub
3. **Describe your changes** clearly in the PR description
4. **Link any related issues**

## 📋 Issue Guidelines

### Before Creating an Issue
